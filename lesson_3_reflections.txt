When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote repository will be helpful when a project is collaborative.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  	In the instance when changes are not commit-able, it is best for the user to decide
	when to commit instead of automating commits.
